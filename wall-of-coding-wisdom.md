# Wall of Coding Wisdom

> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."
> - [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)

> "Rules of optimization:
> 1. Don't
> 2. Don't...yet
> 3. Profile before optimizing."
> - [Michael Jackson](https://wiki.c2.com/?RulesOfOptimization)

> "As a programmer, never underestimate your ability to come up with ridiculously complex solutions for simple problems"
> - [Thomas Fuchs](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/641363170481672193)

> "Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself."
> - [David Jones](https://www.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs340/spring05/coursestuff/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf)

> "The #1 rule of distribute computing: Don’t distribute your computing! At least if you can in any way avoid it."
- [DHH (David Heinemeier Hanson)](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/)

> "Scalability. The #1 problem people don’t actually have but still solve."
> - Eberhard Wolff

> "Shared + Mutable = Danger!"
> - [Andrey Breslav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsaFVLr8t4E)

> "Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction."
> - [Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)

> 1. Avoid premature distribution.
> 2. Avoid premature abstraction.
> Both offer a lure of purity, cleanliness and scalability but add complexity and operational/cognitive overhead.

> Data dominates.
> If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident.
> Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
> - [Rob Pike](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html)

> New Compassionate Tech Values:
